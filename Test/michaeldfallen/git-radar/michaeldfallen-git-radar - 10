You could just have a makefile cat everything together, so long as you remember to run it before each commit.\r\n\r\nThen your install instructions could be simple and transparent:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nwget -O ~/.git-radar.bashrc https://raw.githubusercontent.com/michaeldfallen/git-radar/master/.git-radar.bashrc\r\nsed -i -e '/.git-radar.bashrc/d' ~/.bashrc\r\necho source ~/.git-radar.bashrc >>~/.bashrc\r\nsource ~/.git-radar.bashrc\r\n```"
