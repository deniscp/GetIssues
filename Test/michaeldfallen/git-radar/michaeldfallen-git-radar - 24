    "body": "There's one discrepancy from `git status --short` that annoys me, and that is that untracked files are marked with `??` in the status, but with a grey `A` in `git-radar`. I understand that that is because there's a relation between untracked and added files, but I'd rather have the output resemble what I see in `git status --short`, which matches my mental model better. Is there a way to change the individual symbols?"
