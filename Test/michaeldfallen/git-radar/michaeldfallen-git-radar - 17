    "body": "First of all, `git-radar` is brilliant! :smiley: Great Work!\r\n\r\nI do notice that the prompt could get quite long, depending of the status of your git project. For example: `git:(upstream ⚡long-named-branch xx) 1A 1D1M 1A1` could be a little long.\r\n\r\nI wonder if people would be interested in adding an optional `--minimal` arg to the `git-radar` command, so when present, both the `git:` and the remote commits status (i.e: `upstream ⚡`) will not be shown. The reason i'm suggesting to hide the remote commits status is because i don't rely on it 100% of the time, but again, I'm curious to see what others think.\r\n\r\nThe other option could be for this `--minimal` arg to only hide the `git:` part, and then have another arg `--no-remote-status` that, if present, will hide the remote commits status part of the prompt.\r\n\r\nI will be more than happy to help implementing this feature. Let me know what you think.\r\n\r\nCheers!"
