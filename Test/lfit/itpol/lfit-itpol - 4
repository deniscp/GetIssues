    "body": "Hi,\r\n\r\ncoreboot is an alternate firmware for different platforms. See www.coreboot.org .\r\nIt also possible with coreboot to build a secure boot based on GRUB2. On chromebooks you can use chrome os firmware which is based on coreboot. \r\nSee https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/third_party/coreboot/ .\r\nGoogle provides all firmware as open source even the embedded controller firmware is open.\r\nSee https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/platform/ec/ .\r\nI guess the chromebooks are the most secure and open solution for firmware security...\r\nMaybe this should be listed as alternative option for running a safe linux workstation\r\n\r\nRegards Zaolin"
