Create a migration to add an \"is_following\" column to the users_users table.\r\n* OR, it might be better to just have a separate users_following table? Not sure.\r\n* Use the ApiAttributes event to add an \"isFollowing\" attribute to the UserSerializer.\r\n* Add code to persist the \"isFollowing\" attribute using the UserWillBeSaved event.\r\n* Extend the UserControls util's `userControls` method to add a \"follow\" button for logged-in users, that toggles/saves the isFollowing attribute.\r\n* Add code to the NotifyNewPosts listener to send notifications to users who are following the post author.\r\n"
