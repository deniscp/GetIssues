See http://discuss.flarum.org/d/336-potential-l10n-stumbling-blocks/5\r\n* Find any other hardcoded translations by temporarily emptying en.yml and searching far and wide for text that is still in English.\r\n* Do the same for all default extensions.\r\n* Make the whole administration section translatable (it is all hardcoded at the moment)."
