    "body": "We need to solidify our strategy for naming translation keys, and apply it globally for consistency. Initial discussion took place here: http://discuss.flarum.org/d/336-potential-l10n-stumbling-blocks/10\r\n\r\nThe basic idea is to have **context-related suffixes** for similar translations (see stumbling block 4) and **prefixes** to group related translations (stumbling block 5). However, this strategy needs further refinement, and then needs to be applied.\r\n\r\nWhat needs to be done:\r\n\r\n* Go through all components in js/forum/src/components, looking for instances of `app.trans`, cross-matching the keys with their translations in locale/en.yml. Rename keys where necessary so that they are consistent and descriptive.\r\n* Through this process, come up with a brief list of rules/guidelines to follow when naming translation keys.\r\n* Apply the strategy to default extension translations too."
