My initial thought is that there could be a \"select\" option in the discussion/post controls menu, and when clicked, all of the controls menus for other discussions/posts turn into checkboxes. The action buttons could then be displayed in a box floating somewhere on the page?\r\n* Work out implementation on the front-end. It will likely involve objects similar to DiscussionControls and PostControls.\r\n* Work out implementation on the API-end. It will likely involve the [JSON-API Bulk extension](http://jsonapi.org/extensions/bulk/).\r\n"
