    "body": "We want to allow uploading a custom favicon and header image. Additionally it'd be cool to show a live preview (using an SVG) of what the color scheme will look like. Something like this:\r\n\r\n![screen shot 2015-08-28 at 1 26 03 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/128862/9538854/60f6fee2-4d88-11e5-9d42-7457c93209e0.png)\r\n\r\nWhat needs to be done:\r\n* Add API endpoints for uploading a favicon and a header image.\r\n* Redesign/add fields to the AppearancePage component.\r\n* Design a simple SVG showing Flarum's basic layout, and give the appropriate elements class names so they can have their colors changed via JavaScript.\r\n* Hook up the color buttons in the AppearancePage to update the preview SVG."
