    "body": "Hello Guys got a clean install of flarum but can not access the admin page or api pages causing most features to fail adding post etc. \r\n\r\nThe Apache error I am getting is \r\n\r\n    [Fri Aug 28 08:35:46.846842 2015] [negotiation:error] [pid 13] [client 172.17.0.8:52863] AH00687: Negotiation: discovered file(s) matching request: /var/www/site/api (None could be negotiated)., referer: http://forum.robrotheram.com/\r\n\r\n\r\nMy usecase is a little odd but sould not be causing any issues since I have other webapps running without any problem. My use case is running the webapp in a docker container that has apache installed and mod rewrite enabled. The container then sits behind a nginx container used as a load balancer. but even if I connect to the container directly I still get the same error so its not the ngix load balance causing the issue. \r\n\r\n    [Fri Aug 28 08:36:35.836774 2015] [negotiation:error] [pid 12] [client 172.17.0.8:52991] AH00687: Negotiation: discovered file(s) matching request: /var/www/site/admin (None could be negotiated)., referer: http://robrotheram.com:8087/ \r\n\r\nI made sure that the folders are writable since I set them to 777 (I know its bad but I was testing what was causing the problem)\r\n"
