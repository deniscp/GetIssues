Currently the code to implement this functionality is duplicated in each instance. We should extract it into a reusable core util.\r\n\r\nWhat needs to be done:\r\n\r\n* Using the Search component as a base, work out a way to extract the following parts into a reusable core util:\r\n    * The input's keydown event\r\n    * The `getCurrentNumericIndex`, `getItem` and `setIndex` methods\r\n* Allow the Tab key to select an item, in the same way that the Enter key does."
