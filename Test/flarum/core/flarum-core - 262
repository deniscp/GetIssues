    "body": "To reduce Flarum's scope and make it more maintainable, we should consider extracting some application-agnostic code into external packages. Specifically:\r\n\r\n* Our component paradigm that sits on top of Mithril (i.e. the base `Component` class).\r\n* Some of the Mithril utilities, like `classList` and `SubtreeRetainer`.\r\n* The whole JavaScript data layer: `Store` and `Model`.\r\n* More of the JSON-API layer, specifically the Actions and Request/Response stuff may be within the scope of the tobscure/json-api package.\r\n\r\nKeen to get some thoughts on whether or not this is a good idea, and more than happy for anyone to have a go at extracting some stuff.\r\n"
