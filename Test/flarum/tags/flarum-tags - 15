Could be handy for doing some special tag-based styling.\r\n\r\nWhat needs to be done:\r\n* Extend IndexPage's `config` method to add a class (`IndexPage--tag--{slug}`) to the body based on the currently-active tag. Ensure that it is removed properly onunload.\r\n* Extend DiscussionPage's `config` method to add classes (`DiscussionPage--tag--{slug}`) to the body based on the current discussion's tags. Ensure that they are removed properly onunload.\r\n* Extract core's DiscussionListItem classes into a method that returns an object of class names, which is then applied to the root element using the classList util.\r\n* Extend that new classNames method and add classes (`DiscussionListItem--tag--{slug}`) based on the discussion's tags.\r\n"
