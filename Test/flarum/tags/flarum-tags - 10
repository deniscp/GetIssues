    "body": "On mobile, having too many tags pushes the \"last reply\" info off the screen. Even on desktop, too many tags and a long discussion title can overlap. We should limit the discussion list to displaying 3 tags.\r\n\r\nWhat needs to be done:\r\n\r\n* Add a new prop (maybe `count`) to the tagLabels util. If the prop is set, splice the tags beyond that number off.\r\n* Make use of that prop in the addTagLabels initializer when extending the DiscussionListItem's infoItems.\r\n* Add some padding to the DiscussionListItem title so it's less likely to overlap tags."
