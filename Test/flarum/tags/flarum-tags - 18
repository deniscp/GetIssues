    "body": "Looking at a forum like http://nintendoninjanews.com the tag colors are very strong/a bit harsh on the eye. We should present a range of soft color presets when picking the tag color to encourage nicer color choice. Similar to selecting a color when creating a GitHub issue label. We will still allow for a custom color to be entered if desired."
