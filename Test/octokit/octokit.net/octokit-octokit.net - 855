    "body": "As discussed in issue #504 \r\n\r\nAllows the user to get the contents of the last ApiInfo (so last Api call).  Provided as a property of GitHubClient which calls a property of Connection then a property of HttpClientAdapter.\r\n\r\nThe most obvious use for it is to check the current rate limit without making a separate API call.\r\n\r\nTwo concerns for me:\r\n\r\n* Can't put a test in for the HttpClientAdapter.  The underlying HttpClient is concrete and the send method is not virtual so can be substituted.  Could abstract the HttpClient (interface and wrapper) - this would help to put more testing into for the HttpClientAdapter (currently quite light).\r\n* Must be a better design than having to implement a property through every layer\r\n\r\nThanks"
