    "body": "A number of integration tests use the Helper.GetBadCredentialsClient()\r\n\r\nThis function uses the existing credentials to create an invalid credentials (using the current login).\r\n\r\nHowever if you are testing with an auth token, then the current credentials will not have the login (just the auth token).\r\n\r\nTo fix - just needs a bit of tidy up in the helper."
