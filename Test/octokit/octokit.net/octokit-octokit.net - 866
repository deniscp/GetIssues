    "body": "I'm using Octokit.net to filter issues in a repository using the **Issue.GetAllForRepository(owner,name,request)**.   \r\nIn the request I set the property **Since** to set the time filter and the Property *Labels* to filter for a set of labels: I would like to find all the issues that have at least one of these labels, but from the results I think that are selected only the issues have all these labels.\r\nIs possible to configure the request so every issue that has at least one label is found? At the moment I have to do a single request for every label."
