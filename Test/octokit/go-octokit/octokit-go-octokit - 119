    "body": "Users should not need to know how go-octokit generates hypermedia urls internally. The fact that people must provide maps with aleatory keys to those methods to call the api is a bad smell. Octokit should provide high level functions to perform every operation. Something like:\r\n\r\n```go\r\nclient.Repositories().Get(\"octokit\", \"go-octokit\")\r\nclient.Repositories().Fork(\"octokit\", \"go-octokit\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd so on.\r\n\r\nI'll open a PR soon with a few of those methods, but providing all of them can be a community effort.\r\nFeel free to claim resources that you want to modify yourself commenting in this issue.\r\n\r\nTODO:\r\n\r\n- [ ] Repositories (@calavera)\r\n"
